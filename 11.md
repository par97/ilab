## Debug Data Foundation installation issue

The isf-cns operator in Fusion namespace is the component to install Data Foundation service. We need to check the OdfManager CR status which include error message of the installation, and also can check the isf-cns operator logs.

A common installation issue is failed to create subscription for data foundation service, itâ€™s caused by the Data Foundation images is not mirrored. The odfmanager CR would have the error message "error to create subscription" and the CatalogSource "isf-data-foundation-catalog" status would be failure.
