IBM Storage Fusion is a container-native hybrid cloud data platform that offers simplified deployment and data management for Kubernetes applications on Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform. It is available as two deployments:

a) IBM Storage Fusion. It is a software-defined storage management software with protection, backup, and caching elements and can be run on existing hardware resources. To know more about IBM Storage Fusion, see https://ibm.com/docs/en/storage-fusion-software/2.8.x.
b) IBM Storage Fusion HCI System. It is a purpose-built, hyper-converged architecture that is designed to deploy bare metal Red HatOpenShift container management and deployment software alongside IBM Storage Fusion software. For consistent and rapid deployment and management, it features an appliance form-factor, hyper-converged infrastructure along with integrated software-defined storage to meet the storage requirements of modern, stateful Kubernetes applications. Built with a storage platform that includes the essential elements necessary for mission-critical containers and hybrid cloud, the IBM Storage Fusion provides a comprehensive infrastructure with compute, networking, and storage resources, including a data platform and global data services for Red Hat OpenShift.
