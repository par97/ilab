## The benefit of using IBM Storage Fusion

IBM Storage Fusion offers many benefits:

a) Modernize AI workloads. Supports GPU accelerated applications with NVIDIA A100 GPU nodes and integrates IBM Cloud Paks to infuse AI. For more details about the supported versions of IBM Cloud Paks and prerequisites, see IBM Cloud Paks support for IBM Storage Fusion.
b) Organize and optimize resources. Get file, volume, and object access across disparate data sources â€” including traditional storage, IBM storage, as well as cloud and edge.
c) Enterprise storage and data services. Publish storage profiles and protection policies as automated deployment models designed for seamless use.
d) Access data without data movement. Provide data accessibility both universally across platforms and locally across the information estate.
e) Automate data protection. Provision data using policies and protection methods stretching from local disc to remote to cloud and even to tape.
f) Adjust resources non-disruptively. Shift data from one repository type to another without the need to refactor the data.
g) Adopt new services non-disruptively. Roll any IBM Storage Fusion updates into the data services automatically and without intervention.
h) Hybrid cloud integration.Improve application collaboration that is connecting data from the data center to the cloud and bringing more application agility. It integrates the data center to public cloud resources.
i) Speed development in IBM Storage Fusion HCI System. Preconfigured infrastructure to develop cloud native applications faster (DevOps).
j) Ease operations in IBM Storage Fusion HCI System. All-in-one solution to simplify management with scalability for future growth (ITOps).
k) Lower cost of infrastructure in IBM Storage Fusion HCI System. Connects data silos to avoid duplication of data and merges compute and storage to lower infrastructure costs.
