## Use the IBM Fusion backup/restore to protect applications

The IBM Fusion  backup/restore service can protect applications with below steps:

Step 1: Connect your cluster, Create connections to the clusters that you provide backup services for. If you are only backing up applications in this cluster, you can skip this step. Use any of the following methods to generate the YAML. 
Step 2: Connect backup locations, Connect S3 compatible object storage locations that stores the backups. 
Step 3: Create backup policies, Define backup frequency, storage location, and how long they are retained. 
Step 4: Protect your applications. Assign backup policies to your applications. 
Step 5: Protect your Backup & Restore service. Protect the backup service by backing up the control plane to an S3 bucket. You can restore the backup service in another cluster in the event that this cluster fails.
